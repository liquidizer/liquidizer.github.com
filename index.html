  <h1>What is the Liquidizer</h1>

  The Liquidizer is an interactive voting game. 
  It is used to find a collective answer to a number
  of conflicting questions or demands. It differs 
  from similar projects like <a href="http://doodle.com">
  Doodle</a> or <a href="http://limesurvey.com">LimeSurvey</a>.
  The Liquidizer can handle a much larger amount of conflicting
  questions, because finding optimal answers is made
  a collaborative experice. Rich visualizations of conflicting
  positions, trends, and matches allow for an indepth
  reflection of a groups own preferences.
