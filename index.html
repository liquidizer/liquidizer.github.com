  <h1>What is the Liquidizer</h1>

  The Liquidizer is an interactive voting game. 
  It is used to find a collective answer to a number
  of conflicting questions or demands. It differs 
  from similar projects like <a href="http://doodle.com">
  Doodle</a> or <a href="http://limesurvey.com">LimeSurvey</a>.
  The Liquidizer can handle a much larger amount of conflicting
  questions, because finding optimal answers is made
  a collaborative experice. Rich visualizations of conflicting
  positions, trends, and matches allow for an indepth
  reflection of a groups own preferences.

  <h1>Installation</h1>
  On Ubuntu you can install the Liquidizer by the following commands:
  <code>
  sudo apt-get install git-core maven2 gnuplot graphviz
  git clone git://github.com/liquidizer/liquidizer.git
  cd liquidizer
  mvn jetty:run
  </code>
  After that a new Liquidizer instance will be accessible on
  <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.
