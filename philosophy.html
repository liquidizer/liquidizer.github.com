      <h2 id="sec-1"> The difficulty of making a decision </h2>
      <p>
	A lot of research has been spent on the process of decision
	making in large groups. While we easily find widely accepted
	solutions within groups of friends, the process somehow does
	not scale up to larger and more distant groups of individuals.
      </p>

      <h2 id="sec-2"> The social dilemma </h2>
      <p>
	An often suggested approach of decision making in
	hierarchy-free organizations is found in a democratic
	vote. However, voting is known to produce suboptimal and
	disfactory solutions for the group if it is applied without a
	deep understanding for the values of the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
	More often than not, we will end up in a situation where a
	majority overrules a minority in an issue without high
	involvement or with only superficial information. At the same
	time, a minority group of specialists might be overruled. A
	large amount of unhappiness is created without a corresponding
	benefit.
      </p>

      minority is harshely overruled.</p>

      <h2 id="sec-3"> Cooperative voting </h2>
      <p>
	We will all end up at being within the minority group of
	specialists sooner or later. Wouldn't we all be better off if
	we abstained from voting when we are not directly affected or
	are just not as informed about the issue as we could be?
	Knowing when to vote cooperatively is a major problem in large
	groups. Each time such an opportunity is lost, potential
	happiness is wasted.
      </p>

      voting. They accept a minor degree of dissatisfaction in favor
      of some crucial minority interests.</p>

      <h2 id="sec-4"> Liquidizer </h2>
      <p>
	The Liquidizer voting platform goes a new path of the decision
	making procedure. It can act as a traditional vote counting
	engine, if that feature is requested. But, it can do much
	more.
      </p>

      <p class="caption">In traditional voting people secretely fill in the ballot
      sheet with their oppinion about an issue. The results are
      derived by simple vote counting schemes.
      </p>

      <p>
	The Liquidizer is not so much about voting what you want to be
	the solution. Rather, you cast your votes according to what
	you think is good for the group. The system then gives you
	visual and quantitative feedback on who is affected by your
	suggestions. If the system is used interactively good
	compromises can be negotiated quickly.
      </p>

      issues. It gives you visual and quantitative feedback on how
      well it matches group interests.</p>

      <h2 id="sec-5"> Conclusion </h2>

      <p>
	The Liquidizer does certainly not provide the answer for all
	kinds of decision making problems. There might be situations,
	where you need the answer within a strict time frame and
	without lengthy interactive consultation. Sometimes even
	complete anonymity is of utmost importance.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Liquidizer can be seen as a quantitatively supported
	discussion forum. Conflicts, majorities, and intensity of
	convictions can be visualized and therefore understood much
	more quickly. Yet, the system does not make a decision for
	you, unless you deliberately decide when and how this should
	happen.
